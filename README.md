**Learn everything you need to build modern software using Go**

## What is this book about?
Master real-world development in “Go Programming – From Beginner to Professional”. From the basics to advanced topics, gain proficiency by mastering applications, database interactions, RESTful APIs, concurrency and more using Go idiomatic practices.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the Go syntax and apply it proficiently to handle data and write functions
* Debug your Go code to troubleshoot development problems
* Safely handle errors and recover from panics
* Implement polymorphism using interfaces and gain insight into generics
* Work with files and connect to popular external databases
* Create an HTTP client and server and work with a RESTful web API
* Use concurrency to design efficient software
* Use Go tools to simplify development and improve your code

## Instructions and Navigations

All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:

```
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
 fmt.Println(10 > 5)
 fmt.Println(10 == 5)
}
```

## OS Specific Instructions
* Sometimes some of the executable generated while running "go build" may not directly work for Windows, try running"go run ." or "go run main.go"
* For Exercise 13.03, "cat" command is OS specific, "type" command would work for Windows.
* Running Exercise 13.04 may show some OS specific errors, replacing "echo" in code with "print" works for Windows.
* Exercise 14.01 applies for unix-like systems (linux and macOS). Windows does not work with signals the same way so this exercise will not work for windows.

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Designed for both complete beginners in Go as well as professionals transitioning from another programming language, this book equips developers with skills needed to build real-world projects and launch their career in Go. With a step-by-step approach, beginners can grasp Go fundamentals even without prior programming experience, and gradually advance to idiomatic Go best practices, exploring the latest features of the language.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-21).
