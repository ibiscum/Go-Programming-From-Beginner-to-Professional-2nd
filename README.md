## Instructions and Navigations

All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:

```
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
 fmt.Println(10 > 5)
 fmt.Println(10 == 5)
}
```

## OS Specific Instructions
* Sometimes some of the executable generated while running "go build" may not directly work for Windows, try running"go run ." or "go run main.go"
* For Exercise 13.03, "cat" command is OS specific, "type" command would work for Windows.
* Running Exercise 13.04 may show some OS specific errors, replacing "echo" in code with "print" works for Windows.
* Exercise 14.01 applies for unix-like systems (linux and macOS). Windows does not work with signals the same way so this exercise will not work for windows.

**Following is what you need for this book:**
